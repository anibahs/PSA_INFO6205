        "\n",
        "A flow in a network is a function that assigns a non-negative value to each edge, representing the amount of flow passing through that edge. A feasible flow is one that satisfies the capacity constraint, i.e., the flow passing through an edge cannot exceed its capacity. The net flow into a node (except the source and sink nodes) must also be zero, i.e., the amount of flow entering a node must be equal to the amount of flow leaving it.\n",
